[TODO: fix visual error on How To Win, change VS Instructions header to be translated]
If anybody has a better icon for hurrican class than a cloud with a lightning bold, which can fit in 18 pixels of vertical space, please let me know in Issues!

As far as I can tell, I've translated everything except the plain text and the credits.

Translating the plain text is far beyond my capabilities, unfortunately.* This means that the text of the tutorials, along with the description of the difference between Crane and Slide remain in Japanese.

*(Part of my issue is that AFAIK these use a BIOS font, and idk how to work around that)
