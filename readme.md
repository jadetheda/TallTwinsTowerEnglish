*NOTE:
If anybody has a better icon for hurricane class than a cloud with a lightning bolt, which can fit in 18 pixels of vertical space, please let me know in Issues!*

**All text is now translated, except for the credits, the plaintext tutorials, and the plaintext Crane vs Slide screen!**

Translating the plain text is far beyond my capabilities, unfortunately. It uses the Japan BIOS font for these (a font I cannot change), and idek where the text is stored lol. 

Please, please, please -- even if you can just help with some of that, I'd love to hear from you! Better yet, if you can contribute, I'd love you and merge it immediately! 

Feel free to message me on here in Issues, even if you just have comments lol -- I worked rly hard on this, and would love to hear back from the void

Alrighty, that's all from me! I hope you enjoy my first ever hack!
